# Token Market App Connector

Local connector for WindyPear advanced chat assistant mode.

The connector registers a local device with the backend, polls for tool tasks,
asks for local approval before file edits, and sends task results back to the
backend. The workspace directory is selected in the web session settings.

## Run

Generate a connector token in Advanced Chat > Devices, then run:

```powershell
go run . -server http://localhost:8080 -token <connector-token>
```

## Permissions

The connector only handles tasks for the absolute workspace path selected in
the web session settings, and verifies that directory exists locally before any
tool runs. Paths from the model must be relative to the workspace root.

Read-only actions run directly:

- `list_files`
- `read_file`

Editing actions require local approval in the terminal unless `-yes` is passed:

- `write_file`
- `replace_text`

## Build

```powershell
go build -o token-market-app.exe .
```
